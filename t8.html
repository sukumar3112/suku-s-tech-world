        <td><h3><em>Oppo has increased the prices of some of its smartphone in the Indian market. Handsets from the company's budget and mid-range portfolio — Oppo A11k, Oppo A53s, Oppo A15, Oppo A15s, and Oppo F19 — have reportedly got an increase of up to Rs. 1,000. While the Chinese company hasn't issued any statement on the reason, reports suggest this could be due to the increasing manufacturing incurred by Oppo as a result of ongoing crises for chipsets in the market.

The price hike for Oppo smartphones was tipped by tipster Abhishek Yadav, and later 91Mobiles cited retail sources on the increase in the smartphones' prices.

Gadgets 360 has reached out to Oppo for a comment on the price hike. We will update this report once we get any official information.</em></h3></td>
