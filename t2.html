        <td><h3><em>Mi 11 Ultra limited quantity sale will start on July 7 at 12pm (noon), Global VP of Xiaomi Manu Kumar Jain has announced on Twitter. The phone was launched in India in April, but due to “circumstances beyond our [Xiaomi's] control” there was a delay in shipments of the phone a sale date was not announced. Last week, Xiaomi announced it will be hosting a limited quantity sale in India for the Mi 11 Ultra and now the date has been made official.

Mi 11 Ultra sale, price in India
Mi 11 Ultra will be available for purchase in India starting 12pm (noon) on July 7 but in limited quantity, as per the tweet by Jain. Those interested in purchasing the flagship offering will have to register or log in with their Mi Id on Mi.com and purchase an “ultra gift card” worth Rs. 1,999, which will give them guaranteed access to the sale. This gift card can be redeemed at the time of purchasing the Mi 11 Ultra. On the day of the sale, those who purchased the “ultra gift card” will get an “ultra F-code” which they can use to access the limited quantity sale.

Another way to get access to the sale is through the company's “ultra challenge”, which includes three challenges the customers can participate in via social media. The company also has an SBI Credit card offer that brings a Rs. 5,000 instant discount on the phone.</em></h3></td>
