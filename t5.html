    <h1><u>Nokia G20 Pre-Booking Starts July 7 at 12 Noon on Amazon, Price Leaked : </u></h1>

        <td><h3><em>Nokia G20 will be available for pre-booking in India from July 7, its Amazon listing has revealed. The price for the phone was also seemingly revealed through the banner on the e-commerce website, but it has since been edited to exclude the price. The phone will be a budget-friendly offering that packs a quad rear camera setup. There's a pattern on the back and the phone will be offered in two colour options. The phone will come with a notched display and is claimed to feature a long-lasting battery.

Nokia G20 price in India, availability
Nokia G20 is said to start at Rs. 12,999, but its RAM + storage configuration has not been shared. It seems Amazon has edited this banner (as seen in the main image) to remove the price and keep the pre-booking date â€” July 7 at 12pm (noon). Back in April, a 4GB RAM + 64GB storage variant of the Nokia G20 was tipped, which will likely be the configuration of its base model expected to be priced at Rs. 12,999.

The banner with the price was spotted by NokiaMob. Gadgets 360 has reached out to Nokia brand-licensee HMD Global to get clarification on the pricing.</em></h3></td>
