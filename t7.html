        <td><h3><em>Samsung Galaxy A03s launch in India could be around the corner as the smartphone has apparently received a certification from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The new Samsung phone, that first surfaced online in May, is expected to debut as a successor to last year's Galaxy A02s and include features such as triple rear cameras and a waterdrop-style display notch. In addition to the BIS certification, Samsung Galaxy A03s has also surfaced on the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) website.

As reported by MySmartPrice, Samsung Galaxy A03s has appeared on the BIS website wit model number SM-A037F/DS. The listing, which Gadgets 360 independently verified, also confirms that the phone received the certification just on Thursday.

The BIS certification doesn't mention whether the listed phone is Samsung Galaxy A03s. But nonetheless, the certification appearing on the Bluetooth SIG site clearly shows that the model number SM-A037F/DS is associated with the phone that has the Galaxy A03s product name.</em></h3></td>
