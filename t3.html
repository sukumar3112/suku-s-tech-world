      <td><h3><em>Motorola Edge 20, Motorola Edge 20 Lite, and Motorola Edge 20 Pro are tipped to be the names of the next smartphones from the Lenovo-owned brand. These phones were earlier known by their codenames Motorola Edge Berlin/ Berlin NA, Motorola Edge Kyoto, and Motorola Edge PStar smartphones, respectively. A previous leak suggests that the three new smartphones from Motorola will launch by the end of this month and their specifications have also surfaced online. The upcoming Motorola Edge 20 series smartphones are expected to be the successors of the Edge series —  Motorola Edge and Motorola Edge+ —  that launched last year.

A tweet from tipster Evan Blass (@evleaks) says that the Motorola Edge Berlin and Edge Berlin NA will launch as Motorola Edge 20, while Motorola Edge Kyoto will be called Motorola Edge 20 Lite. Similarly, the Motorola Edge PStar is expected to be named Motorola Edge 20 Pro.

Blass had earlier tweeted the upcoming Motorola Edge 20 series smartphones could launch "at the very end of July".</em></h3></td>
